## Patra Store Dapps

[Patract](https://patract.network) is a parallel chain focused on Polkadot Wasm contract development, and today we are officially launching [PatraStore](https://patrastore.io), which is Patract's system wallet and portal to the on-chain DApp ecosystem, and will bring together developer and user traffic to form a one-stop DApp OS experience. We have developed 6 example DApps for PatraStore that are most representative in various aspects, which is the first complete demonstration of real deployable and experienceable contract applications within the Polkadot ecosystem.

These include 3 DeFi applications:

- [PatraAsset](https://patrastore.io/jupiter-a1/dapps/patra-asset.dapps.patrastore.io), which issues a fixed number or incremental ERC20 assets with one click.
- [PatraSwap](https://patrastore.io/jupiter-a1/dapps/patraswap.dapps.patrastore.io), a simplified version of Uniswap, based on the AMM model of DEX.
- [PatraMaker](https://patrastore.io/jupiter-a1/dapps/maker.dapps.patrastore.io), collateralized DOT issuance of stable coins, a simplified version of MakerDAO.

These include 3 game applications:

- [PatraPK](https://patrastore.io/jupiter-a1/dapps/pk-game.dapps.patrastore.io): two against two, a crypto version of rock-paper-scissors with penalties and incentives.
- [PatraPixel](https://patrastore.io/jupiter-a1/dapps/patra-pixel.dapps.patrastore.io): public canvas, pay DOT to paint on public advertising boards.
- [PatraLottery](https://patrastore.io/jupiter-a1/dapps/lottery.dapps.patrastore.io): random lottery, decentralized and secure random numbers generated from the BABE consensus of Polka.


PatraStore currently supports Jupiter A1, our PoA test network, and will support our public parallel chains on Kusama and Polkadot in the future Patract K1 and Patract P1, as well as other parallel chains we support that include Wasm contract technology. patraStore currently only supports the PC browser side, and will support mobile wallets in the future.
